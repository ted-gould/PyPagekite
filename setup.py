PageKite is a system for running publicly visible servers (generally
web servers) on machines without a direct connection to the Internet,
such as mobile devices or computers behind restrictive firewalls.
PageKite works around NAT, firewalls and IP-address limitations by
using a combination of  tunnels and reverse proxies.

Natively supported protocols: HTTP, HTTPS

Any other TCP-based service, including SSH and VNC, may be exposed
as well to clients supporting HTTP Proxies.
